# In order for the application to work, a file named config/aws.yml must exist.
# You can use this file as a template: simply copy it, rename it and tailor its
# contents. Please note that both aws.yml and aws.yml.example must exist - don't
# delete this example file, as its values will be used by TeamCity for tests.
#
# If your application doesn't use any AWS functionality, you should delete both
# aws.yml.example and aws.yml. In that case, none of them may exist in your application.
#
# NB: the Chef recipes used to deploy the application to its Chef environment (master,
# staging, prod) will replace the contents of config/aws.yml with an auto-generated file.

# It is safe to set any of the following three environments to

# You can use *amazon instead of *local if you wish.
