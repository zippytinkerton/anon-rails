# In order for the application to work, a file named config/config.yml must exist.
# You can use this file as a template: simply copy it, rename it and tailor its
# contents. All data in this file will be used to define constants in your application
# namespace. Please note that both config.yml and config.yml.example must exist - don't
# delete this example file, as its values will be used by TeamCity for tests.
# 
# Any constants declared here can be overridden by corresponding environment variables
# starting with OVERRIDE_. Thus, BASE_DOMAIN can be overridden by the environment
# variable OVERRIDE_BASE_DOMAIN, and so forth. The API_PASSWORD receives special
# treatment: you can pass both the master and the staging password separated by a comma,
# and Ocean will choose the appropriate one to use depending on the Chef environment.
#
# NB: the Chef recipes used to deploy this to the production environment will
# replace the contents of config/config.yml with an auto-generated file.

# Make sure the declarations in each section are indented properly.
# NB: these overrides only affect your local development environment (which may run
